/**
 * LValue is implemented by LIM objects which can represent an <i>lvalue</i>. An
 * lvalue, short for "left hand value," is any expression which can appear on
 * the left hand side of an assignment statement. Such an expression designates
 * a region of memory.
 * <P>
 * This region of memory may be either read from or written to, depending on the
 * context in which the lvalue is used. If it is used as the left hand side of
 * an assignment, it is used to write memory. In every other context it
 * represents a read from memory.
 * <P>
 * An LValue has a size, which is the number of addressable locations in the
 * memory region that it denotes. This amount of data transferred when the
 * LValue is read or written is determined by the number of addressable
 * locations accessed and the stride length for the target location in memory.
 * <P>
 * For instance, in the following code <code>
 *   <pre>
 *   i = 5;
 *   f(i);
 *   </pre>
 *   </code> If <code>i</code> is an integer variable, in the first line
 * <code>i</code> is an lvalue that represents a write to the region of memory
 * named by <code>i</code>, and in the second line it is a read from that same
 * region of memory.
 * <P>
 * An lvalue need not be a simple identifier. Here are some other examples of
 * lvalue expressions: <code>
 * <ul> 
 * <li>*p   // pointer indirection
 * <li>a[i] // array subscript
 * <li>(l)  // parenthesized lvalue
 * <li>s.f  // direct struct access
 * <li>s->f // indirect struct access
 * </ul>
 * </code> The thing they all have in common is that they designate a region of
 * memory.
