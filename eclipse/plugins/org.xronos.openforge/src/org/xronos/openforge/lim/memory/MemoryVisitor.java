/**
 * MemoryVisitor is a visitor interface that is used to traverse
 * {@link LogicalMemory LogicalMemories} and their contents. By traversing the
 * LogicalMemory, {@link Allocation Allocations}, and all implementations of
 * {@link LogicalValue} this visitor can be used to visit all classes
 * responsible for the physical contents of any memory. The other types of
 * {@link Location Locations} are not necessary in this visitor as they do not
 * define actual contents of memory but rather they define the nature of
 * accesses to the memory.
