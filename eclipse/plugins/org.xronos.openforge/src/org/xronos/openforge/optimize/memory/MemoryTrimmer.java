/**
 * MemoryTrimmer works in tandem with MemoryReducer to eliminate unused bytes
 * from memory. This class does the simple job of eliminating bytes from
 * Allocations when the whole Allocation is not accessed. Note that does not
 * mean that we can always delete the Allocation. The Allocation may still be
 * the target of an address-of operator, in which case we still need the
 * allocation in order to get an address for it. To accomodate that case, we
 * simply create a 0 length Allocation and replace the non-accessed allocation
 * with it if there are any LocationConstants that refer to it. In the case
 * where there is neither a LocationConstant or an LValue access to the
 * Allocation, it is simply removed.
